Project 4

oss.c serves as the master process, spawning and scheduling user.c processes and
tracking them using a table of process control blocks. These processes will be
queued in a "realtime" round-robin queue or one of three normal class queues
corresponding to high, middle, and low priority.

The schedular in oss.c will dispatch the next process and give it a time slice,
the process will then decide to use it's entire time slice and signal the
schedular to re-queue it, use part of it's time slice and signal the schedular
that it has terminated, or use part of it's time slice and suspend until a
simulated interupt event has completed and signal the schedular to suspend it
until some time in the future.
